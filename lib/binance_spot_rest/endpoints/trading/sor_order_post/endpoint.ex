  #### New order using SOR (TRADE)

  (
    This endpoint is not tested online because of:

    The Smart Order Routing (SOR) feature is not available on the Binance Spot Testnet.
    While Binance's Spot Testnet does offer a way to test trading functionalities using their API,
    it focuses on standard order types like market, limit, stop-limit, and OCO orders.
    SOR, an experimental feature, is specifically available on the mainnet for certain trading pairs
    and is not enabled on the testnet environment.
  )

  ```
  POST /api/v3/sor/order
  ```
